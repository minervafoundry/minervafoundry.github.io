# Minerva Foundry — The Collaboraticve Incubator

Our team develops and seeks out ideas for great projects. We collaborate with each other and others to realize these ideas. And, we’re always looking for exciting people and projects that fit with what we’re working towards.

## Defining a “Great Project”

### Making the World Better

We try to make the world a better place by creating things that can have the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. In practice this means we look to solve problems that aren’t being solved properly or at all. We look to the fringes of tech, culture, and people’s needs and cultivate a deep understanding of how to have a substantial positive impact on their lives.

### Sustainability

To make a meaningful positive impact on the world, that impact can not come at environmental or social cost. Sustainability is a core part of every project. But for us, sustainability means more than just the status-quo. It means innovating new ways to leave more behind than we use. 

### Transparency

We think that the best way to deliver good work is to draw on a broad set of ideas, perspectives, skills, and experiences. Transparency promotes feedback, accountability, understanding, honesty, and trust. We are transparent.

We discuss our projects, decisions, motivation, finances, successes, and failures on our blog. We answer questions clearly and honestly. This applies as much within the Minerva team as it does without. We’re transparent through and through. 

## Our projects

Each project is run autonomously. Minerva Foundry’s contribution depends on each project’s unique needs. It always includes advice, networking help, and access to our tool set. We’ve also been known to:

* Work as contributing team members
* Provide seed money
* Help secure investment
* Give the team workspace
